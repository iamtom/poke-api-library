# Poké API Library

## What is it?
Code for interacting with pokeapi.co. I use this in Pokémon Move Finder and 
Pokémon Quiz App.

## Why?
I wanted to make an application that interacted with pokeapi.co. While I
could see that there were already some Java libraries available, interacting with
APIs was new to me and I really wanted to understand more about how that works so
I decided to write my own code.

This was originally part of my Pokémon Quiz App. I wanted to use it in a new 
project that uses Poké API so moved it out to a separate project so it could be 
used as a dependency.

There's a lot of information on pokeapi.co and I've only needed some of it so far.
I made the complete Pokemon object but after that I'm only adding the bits I need
as and when I need them.
