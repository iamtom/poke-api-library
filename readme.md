# Poké API Library

## What is it?
This was originally part of my Pokémon Quiz App.
It was the code used for interacting with Poké API (pokeapi.co).
I wanted to use it in a new project that uses Poké API so moved it out to a 
separate project so it could be used as a dependency.

I am just adding what I need as I go for this project.
